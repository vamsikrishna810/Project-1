Building a chatbot using machine learning typically involves training a model on a dataset. One popular approach is to use a sequence-to-sequence model. Below is a simplified example using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for training a chatbot:

1. Install Required Libraries
2. Import Libraries
3. Prepare Dataset
4. Tokenize Texts
5. Build the Model
6. Train the Model
7. Make Predictions
8. Test the Chatbot
